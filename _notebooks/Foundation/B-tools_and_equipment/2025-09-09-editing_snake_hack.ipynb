    "## Snake Game Modifications\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the improvements I added to the  <a href=\"{{site.baseurl}}/snake\" class=\"button small\" style=\"background-color: #6b4bd3ff\">\n",
    "    snake game.\n",
    "</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Change 1: Background color\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing I started with doing was changing the background color to something that more closely resembles the original snake. So, I made the background color a sort of light green.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how I did it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 269:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ctx.fillStyle = \"chartreuse\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "I changed the fill color from being \"royalblue\" to \"chartreuse\" to get a pleasant green color.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Change 2: Checkerboard pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "After changing the background color, I realized that making the background a checkerboard pattern could make the game look nicer and also communicate better where the snake is.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I replaced the section on line 267 from this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "// Repaint canvas\n",
    "ctx.beginPath();\n",
    "ctx.fillStyle = \"chartreuse\";\n",
    "ctx.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "// Repaint canvas\n",
    "ctx.beginPath();\n",
    "const checkerSize = BLOCK*2;\n",
    "for (let y = 0; y < canvas.height; y += checkerSize) {\n",
    "\tfor (let x = 0; x < canvas.width; x += checkerSize) {\n",
    "\t\t// Alternate colors\n",
    "\t\tif (((x / checkerSize) + (y / checkerSize)) % 2 === 0) {\n",
    "\t\t\tctx.fillStyle = \"#7FFF00\"; // light color\n",
    "\t\t} else {\n",
    "\t\t\tctx.fillStyle = \"#62c400ff\"; // dark color\n",
    "\t\t}\n",
    "\t\tctx.fillRect(x, y, checkerSize, checkerSize);\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Essentially, what this does is assign a value as the checker size (in this case it is double the size of the grid square) and then use that size to iterate through each place a checker should be. Then, it checks if that position is an even numbered or odd numbered position, using that it assign a different color to alternating tiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Change 3: Snake and apple colors\n",
    "\n",
    "I noticed that both the snake and the apples had the same colors, which could confuse players and also doesn't look very visually appealing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to fix this I modified the \"activeDot\" function to also take color as an argument\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 340:\n",
    "```\n",
    "let activeDot = function(x, y, color){\n",
    "\tctx.fillStyle = color;\n",
    "\tctx.fillRect(x * BLOCK, y * BLOCK, BLOCK, BLOCK);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This allowed for setting a specific color for the snake and apples whenever the activeDot function was called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting the snake and apple colors to blue and red, respectively:\n",
    "```\n",
    "activeDot(snake[i].x, snake[i].y, \"#1100ffff\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "activeDot(food.x, food.y, \"#f02a2aff\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Change 4: Controls change\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time I would use the arrow key controls in the snake game, it would scroll my webpage up and down. So, I decided to change to using a WASD control scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous input detection code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "switch(key) {\n",
    "\tcase 37:    // left arrow\n",
    "\t\tif (snake_dir !== 1)    // not right\n",
    "\t\t\tsnake_next_dir = 3; // then switch left\n",
    "\t\tbreak;\n",
    "\tcase 38:    // up arrow\n",
    "\t\tif (snake_dir !== 2)    // not down\n",
    "\t\t\tsnake_next_dir = 0; // then switch up\n",
    "\t\tbreak;\n",
    "\tcase 39:    // right arrow\n",
    "\t\tif (snake_dir !== 3)    // not left\n",
    "\t\t\tsnake_next_dir = 1; // then switch right\n",
    "\t\tbreak;\n",
    "\tcase 40:    // down arrow\n",
    "\t\tif (snake_dir !== 0)    // not up\n",
    "\t\t\tsnake_next_dir = 2; // then switch down\n",
    "\t\tbreak;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This code was using the keycodes for the arrow keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Updated input detection code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "switch(key) {\n",
    "\tcase 65:    // A key\n",
    "\t\tif (snake_dir !== 1)    // not right\n",
    "\t\t\tsnake_next_dir = 3; // then switch left\n",
    "\t\tbreak;\n",
    "\tcase 87:    // W key\n",
    "\t\tif (snake_dir !== 2)    // not down\n",
    "\t\t\tsnake_next_dir = 0; // then switch up\n",
    "\t\tbreak;\n",
    "\tcase 68:    // D key\n",
    "\t\tif (snake_dir !== 3)    // not left\n",
    "\t\t\tsnake_next_dir = 1; // then switch right\n",
    "\t\tbreak;\n",
    "\tcase 83:    // S key\n",
    "\t\tif (snake_dir !== 0)    // not up\n",
    "\t\t\tsnake_next_dir = 2; // then switch down\n",
    "\t\tbreak;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This new code changed the keycode after each \"case\" to reference W, A, S, or D rather than referencing the arrow keys.\n",
    "Now this allows for movement with the WASD keys, so that the webpage doesn't scroll when playing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Change 5: Snake head color\n",
    "\n",
    "I realized that the game doesn't really show where the snake's head is very well, so I changed the color of the snakes head in order for the player to always know where it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, the code was just setting the snake to one whole color:\n",
    "```\n",
    "// Paint snake\n",
    "for(let i = 0; i < snake.length; i++){\n",
    "\tactiveDot(snake[i].x, snake[i].y, \"#1100ffff\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what I did was check when the for loop had iterated to the last segment of the snake, and then change that segment to a different color:\n",
    "```\n",
    "// Paint snake\n",
    "for(let i = 0; i < snake.length; i++){\n",
    "\tif (i != 0)\n",
    "\t{\n",
    "\t\tactiveDot(snake[i].x, snake[i].y, \"#1100ffff\");\n",
    "\t\tcontinue;\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "\n",
    "\tactiveDot(snake[i].x, snake[i].y, \"#ffff\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This checks if the loop is on its first iteration, if not, it sets the color of that segment to blue and then starts the next iteration of the loop. If it is on the first iteration, then it sets that segment's color to white.\n"
